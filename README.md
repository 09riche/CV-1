## Laura Wilson

I am an ambitious, analytical and energetic individual, with a degree in Natural Sciences from Cambridge University.

After two years working as a Commodities trader at an investment bank, and a gap year filled with travel and charity fundraising bike rides, I am now pursuing a more intellectually satisfying career in tech, where I'll never run out of new things to learn and can solve puzzles for a living.
