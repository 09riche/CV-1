I am an ambitious, analytical and energetic individual, with a degree in Natural Sciences from the University of Cambridge.

After two years working as a Commodities trader at an investment bank, and a gap year filled with charity fundraising bike rides and independent travel, I am now pursuing a more intellectually satisfying career in tech, where I'll never run out of things to learn.

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator

During my time at Bank of America, I wrote and distributed a daily newsletter to clients, with market commentary and data analysis. I have continued to develop my written communication skills by [blogging](http://codingwithlaura.wordpress.com) about my experience learning to code and I use it to develop a stronger online presence, by combining it with other social media outlets such as [Twitter](https://twitter.com/laura_wilson19).
I have also taken up mentoring two junior students at Makers Academy, who I regularly interact with and help guide their coding.

#### Thrives under pressure

From having to co-organise an end-of-year ball during my final year at university, where the bulk of organisation coincided with completing finals, to completing group [projects](####Makers) and achieving MVP by the deadline in both instances, I have always thrived when working under pressure. It is my strong organisational and time management skills that I have developed over time that allows me to do this.

#### Fast learner

I earned a full-time offer at Bank of America Merrill Lynch by impressing my line manager with how quickly I picked up an understanding of finance and the technologies that the team used, despite having a scientific background and no previous experience in finance. For our [Makersbnb project](http://github.com/lsewilson/makers-bnb), I learnt Node.js and Express without it being taught on the course and used it to build a fully-functioning Airbnb-style website in a week.

#### Analytical thinker

In my role at Bank of America, I analysed new market data on a daily basis to generate trade ideas. Furthermore, I undertook a project to migrate all of our systems and trade history to a new legal entity. This required careful risk analysis which ensured there was no negative P&L impact on completion.
